# Arabic-to-Swahili-Machine-Translation
Building neural machine translation (NMT) systems for low-resource languages
poses several challenges, mainly due to the lack of parallel data. In this research,
we propose a baseline NMT system for translating between Arabic and Swahili.
Despite being spoken by nearly 300 million individuals worldwide, the parallel
corpus between these two languages is severely underrepresented. To address this,
we scraped and processed the largest high-quality parallel corpus of Swahili and
Arabic to our knowledge. We then used state-of-the-art NMT models, including
Transformers and multilingual variants of Transformers, to build a baseline for
bidirectional Arabic-Swahili NMT
